# EGV-9B-9-Band-QRP-CW-Transceiver-Build-Modification
A hands-on project to build the EGV-9B, a complex 9-band QRP CW transceiver kit from EA3GCY. After a meticulous assembly process, the transceiver was enhanced with several custom modifications to improve operator feedback and usability, including a TX LED, a Sotabeams digital audio filter, and a zero-beat indicator.
